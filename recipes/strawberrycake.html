    <p><em>This strawberry cake is easy to make from scratch with strawberry puree and strawberry gelatin.</em> This recipe is worth its weight in gold to me as a caterer. I made this cake for a child's birthday party and it was a major hit! Frost with cream cheese frosting or chocolate ganache for a special treat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Jell-o</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>

        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Strawberries</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. </li>
        <li>Beat sugar, butter, and dry strawberry gelatin together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. </li>
        <li>Combine flour and baking powder in a large bowl; stir into butter mixture alternately with milk. </li>
        <li>Blend in strawberry puree and vanilla. </li>
        <li>Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes; run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack to cool completely. </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
